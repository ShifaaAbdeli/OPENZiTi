forwarder:
  # How frequently does the forwarder probe the link latency. This will ultimately determine the resolution of the
  # responsiveness available to smart routing. This resolution comes at the expense of bandwidth utilization for the
  # probes, control plane utilization, and CPU utilization processing the results.
